# RedM-Watermark
## What Is RedM Watermark? 
All this does is simply draw a logo over your screen (similar to a watermark). A simple fade-in/fade-out animation when toggling the watermark on/off! Enjoy!

## How To Change Logo
* Simply navigate to the `img` folder and change the logo to your own
* YOU MUST NAME THE IMAGE `logo.png` OR IT WILL NOT WORK

## How Can I Change The Position, Size, ETC..
* Edit the `style.css` located in the `html` folder
* I will not provide support for any edits made to the files.

## Credit
* Full credit goes to Jordan.#2139 for the orignal FiveM version (all I did was make it compatiable for RedM)
